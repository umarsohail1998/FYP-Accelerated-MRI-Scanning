# Final Year Project: Accelerated-MRI-Scanning

- The aims was to reduce the acquisition time required by a Traditional MRI machine by collecting a subset of raw data (instead of complete) and generating diagnostic quality scans from this under-sampled Raw Data. 
- The end product was an image reconstruction algorithm that will use different reconstruction and refinements techniques to convert low-resolution scans from under sampled data to diagnostic-quality images..
